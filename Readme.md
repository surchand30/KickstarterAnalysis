KICKSTARTER PROJECT ANALYSIS:

OVERVIEW:

The dataset provides information on different projects that succeeded,failed or were cancelled. A project is considered successful if it met the goal. The dataset provides information on the category and subcategory of the projects, the launch date , the country the project was launched in, how much was raised,number of people who invested in the project.This project will help someone like Louise understand what went wrong with her project and what changes should she make next time around before launching a project.

ANALYSIS AND CHALLENGES:

The dataset comprising of projects launched in different categories spanning across multiple years was analyzed to identify trends which would increase the probability of launching a successful project. The dataset comprised of parameters like launch date,country,category/subcategory,country,goal and number of people who backed the project. 

Analysis on launch date : Analysis on the launch date will provide information on the ideal time of the year to launch a project and have higher chances of success.The data across all the years is combined by month to understand which month has the highest success rate. Launching a new project in this month will have a higher probability of success than launching it in any of the other months.

Analysis on goals : Analysis on goals of successful projects will help analyse what the goal of a kickstarter project should be set to make the project successful. The goal amounts are grouped into buckets to analyze what the goal of a successful project should be set to.

Challenges faced during the analysis :

-> Inconsistent data across years. Many years in the dataset dont have data across all the months
-> The categories/subcategories are not in the same line of business. For example comparing the success or failure of a theatre project against a technology project will not yield meaningful insights.


RESULTS :

Conclusions based on Launch Date:

->Launching a kickstarter project in December has less than 50% chances of succeeding. This could be attributed to the holiday season
->May is the most successful month to launch the kickstarted program. The success rate in May is 67% which is the highest across all the other months in the year.

Outcomes based on Goals: 

->Lesser the goal higher the chance of a project succeeding
->Higher the goal results in very high chances of the project being cancelled since the goal may be was unrealistic

Limitations of the dataset: 

-> Lack of description of data points. The column staff_pick for example is really vague and not usable due to lack of clarity on what it represents
->The data range for successful campaigns is very large. Any campaign that reached its goal is also categorized as Successful and campaigs that raised over 2000% of its goal is also successful.There should be more levels of categorization like Successful,Very Successful etc.
->There is no clear outcome that can be derived from the dataset on how long a campaign should be open. In some instances a campaign that was open for less than a week succeeded and in some instances a campaign that was active for over a month was successful. 

Other Analysis to be performed:

-> Analysis on which country and which category/subcategory people have invested in which had the highest percentage funded
-> Analysis on which category people have invested in with the highest average contribution
-> Analysis on how long should kickstarted campaign be open for investments to be the most successful. Having it open for too long can delay starting work on the campaign and having it open for too short a time may not get in enough interest and investment into the project.
